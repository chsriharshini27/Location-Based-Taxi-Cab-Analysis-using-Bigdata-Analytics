# Location-Based-Taxi-Cab-Analysis-using-Bigdata-Analytics
Location-Based Taxi Cab Analysis utilizes big data analytics to examine patterns in taxi operations, including demand hotspots, trip durations, and driver performance. By analyzing GPS and transaction data, it optimizes route planning, enhances service efficiency, predicts future demand, and improves overall passenger satisfaction.


1. Introduction
This project aims to analyze taxi cab data using big data analytics techniques to gain insights into travel patterns, demand hotspots, driver performance, and more. The project utilizes large datasets, such as taxi trip records, and leverages big data tools and techniques for processing and analysis.

from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

def send_to_kafka(data):
    producer.send('taxi_trip_data', json.dumps(data).encode('utf-8'))

# Example data
data = {
    "pickup_time": "2023-07-23 08:00:00",
    "dropoff_time": "2023-07-23 08:30:00",
    "pickup_location": {"lat": 40.7128, "lon": -74.0060},
    "dropoff_location": {"lat": 40.730610, "lon": -73.935242},
    "fare": 25.00
}

2. Objectives
Analyze spatial and temporal patterns in taxi trips.
Identify high-demand locations and peak times.
Evaluate driver performance and efficiency.
Predict future demand and optimize taxi dispatch.

4. Components
3.1. Data Sources
Taxi Trip Records: Data containing details of each trip, such as pickup/dropoff locations and times, fare, and distance.
External Data: Weather data, event data, and traffic data to provide context to the analysis.


3.2. Big Data Technologies
Hadoop: For distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
Spark: For in-memory data processing and real-time analytics.
Hive: For querying and managing large datasets.
Kafka: For real-time data streaming.
3.3. Tools and Libraries
Python/R: For data analysis and visualization.
Tableau/Power BI: For interactive data visualization.
SQL: For querying data stored in relational databases.

5. Implementation Steps
4.1. Data Collection
Data Ingestion: Use Kafka or Flume to ingest real-time data from taxi meters and external sources.
Data Storage: Store raw data in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).
4.2. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct errors.
Transformation: Normalize and aggregate data to prepare for analysis.
Loading: Load cleaned and transformed data into Hive tables for easy querying.

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, unix_timestamp

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('TaxiDataPreprocessing').getOrCreate()

# Load data from HDFS
df = spark.read.json('hdfs://path/to/taxi_data.json')

# Data cleaning and transformation
df_cleaned = df.dropna().withColumn('pickup_time', unix_timestamp(col('pickup_time')))
df_cleaned = df_cleaned.withColumn('dropoff_time', unix_timestamp(col('dropoff_time')))

# Save cleaned data to Hive
df_cleaned.write.mode('overwrite').saveAsTable('cleaned_taxi_data')


4.3. Data Analysis
Spatial Analysis: Use GIS tools and libraries (e.g., GeoPandas) to analyze pickup/dropoff locations.
Temporal Analysis: Analyze patterns based on time of day, day of the week, and season.
Demand Prediction: Use machine learning models to predict future demand based on historical data.
Driver Performance: Analyze metrics such as average fare, trip duration, and idle time to evaluate driver performance.

from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

# Prepare data for machine learning
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['pickup_lat', 'pickup_lon', 'hour_of_day', 'day_of_week'], outputCol='features')
data = assembler.transform(df_cleaned)

# Train/test split
train_data, test_data = data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])

# Train the model
lr = LinearRegression(labelCol='trip_count')
model = lr.fit(train_data)

# Evaluate the model
predictions = model.transform(test_data)
predictions.select('features', 'trip_count', 'prediction').show()

4.4. Data Visualization
Interactive Dashboards: Use Tableau or Power BI to create dashboards that visualize key insights.
Geospatial Visualizations: Create maps to visualize high-demand locations and trip routes.
